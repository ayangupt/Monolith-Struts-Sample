SkiShop Monolith Coding Guidelines (Phase 0)

- Java 1.5 syntax only (no annotations, lambdas, or generics-heavy APIs).
- Follow layered architecture: Action -> Service -> DAO -> Domain/DTO.
- Use camelCase for variables/methods, PascalCase for classes.
- Log via reload4j (log4j 1.x compatible configuration).
- Struts 1.2.9 is required; Tiles is not configured in Phase 0.
